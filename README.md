# **Summary**

This project is a mobile application built using **Expo Go** that allows users to curate a personalized art exhibition by selecting artworks from various museum collections. Users can search and filter artworks based on keywords or presets, and create a temporary exhibition by selecting artworks they like. The exhibition displays images and detailed information about the selected artworks, with links to find out more or view them in person. The exhibition persists for the duration of the user session, allowing users to interact with their selections.

The app is built using the following tech stack:

- **React Native**: For building the mobile app.
- **Axios**: To interact with the external APIs of the **Harvard Museum** and the **Metropolitan Museum**.
- **React Native Paper**: For UI components and design elements.
- **Jest**: For implementing integration tests of the API interactions.

The app is published and hosted on **Expo Go's** servers, and can be accessed using the Expo Go app. Users can download the Expo Go app from the Play Store, scan the QR code, and load the app on their mobile devices.
